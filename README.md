# Kaggle: BirdCLEF-2022

Repository with the code for [BirdCLEF 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2022).

### Motive
I like my code to be organized in a clean way and the Kaggle's notebook driven development is far from clean. Hence, this repository. 
As the competition does not permit use of the internet, then the code can be put as a "dataset" for later offline use :) 


### Env management

To create:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To update:
```
conda env update -f environment.yml
```

To install editable src"
```
conda develop .
```
